# Research work 
Till now i have take methylation and expression data from Metabric cohort and tried to compute cross correltation between them to see of hypermethylation affects the downstream gene expression. 

## Hypothesis

Promoter DNA methylation is inversely correlated with gene expression in tumor samples compared to adjacent normal tissues.

Specifically, genes that are hypermethylated in tumors will tend to show reduced expression, and genes that are hypomethylated will tend to show increased expression, indicating a potential epigenetic regulatory mechanism driving tumorigenesis.
